# RS_HOTELS
rs_hotel represents a collaborative endeavor between myself and a friend, aiming to create an efficient hotel booking system. The project uniquely combines frontend and backend technologies, with my friend contributing to the frontend development using HTML and CSS, while I focused on the backend, employing PHP and MySQL to drive the system.
